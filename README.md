# L1RMSTCOX
Quantifying and interpreting the prediction accuracy of models for the survival time using mean absolute differences (MAD) – moving beyond C-statistic  

(1) Fit the observed survival time with Cox PH model.
(2) Cauculate restricted mean survival time (RMST) based pn the fitted model in (1).
(3) Calculate MAD.
