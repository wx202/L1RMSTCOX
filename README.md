# L1RMSTCOX
Quantifying and interpreting the prediction accuracy of models for the survival time using mean absolute differences (MAD) 

(1) Fit the observed survival time with Cox PH model.

(2) Cauculate restricted mean survival time (RMST) based on the fitted model in (1).

(3) Calculate MAD using the “inverse probability of censoring weighting” (IPCW) technique.
